Based on a YouTube tutorial created by Jongmin Kim, found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMQ9fEX28fk

Created as an introduction to Pixi.js. 
Refactored and modified slightly from the original.
 I am planning to port it, well try to at least, to TypeScript to explore using Pixi.js via TypeScript.

- Using Pixi.js (via npm) to render via WebGL (via HTML Canvas)
- Uses shaders for post-processing
- Uses Parcel to bundle it up and run dev server
- Mouse/touch to used to interact with the drawing
